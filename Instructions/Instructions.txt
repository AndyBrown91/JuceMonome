How to do stuff:

1. open terminal and type cd then drag in the liblo-0.26 folder
It should look like cd myLeetProgrammingStuff/liblo-0.26 
Press enter

2. type ./configure
3. type sudo make
It will ask for your password but you won't see anything when you type, it is there don't panic press enter
4. type sudo make install

Thats liblo installed next move onto libmonome

5. type cd then drag the libmonome file into terminal
6. type sudo ./waf configure
7. type sudo ./waf
8. type sudo ./waf install

Now everything should be ready and the libmonome library should be installed in /usr/local/lib

10. Open the Xcode project and go to Preferences->Locations->Source trees
I've set the project to look for the libmonome library using this
11. Create a new source tree called LibMonome and display name LibMonome with the path /usr/local/lib

Now compile, if it can't open the monome you may need to change the main component open monome call in the constructor to the correct monomer name

Otherwise everything should work, i've left some hideous experiments in the project but feel free to delete them.

Monome Thread is a very simple thread which listens for callbacks from the monome and then triggers functions in the MonomeGui class.
